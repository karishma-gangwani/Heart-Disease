# Heart-Disease 
     This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments
     refer to using a subset of 14 of them.  In particular, the Cleveland
     database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to 
     this date.  The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease
     in the patient.  It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.
     Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply
     attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value
     0).  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77972514/120037768-26ccf080-bfd0-11eb-96b9-f2fee49c6de2.png)
